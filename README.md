# YNAB Scripts

A small collection of bookmarklets and scripts for performing actions in YNAB that aren't available through the app itself.

These work by directly manipulating/clicking the DOM â€” I imagine things like this can be done cleaner and faster using the API, but I haven't bothered to look into that yet. Use at your own risk.

Feel free to contribute improvements or additional scripts via pull request.

## Installation

Just create a bookmark, and make the URL the one-line script for a given function, then click the bookmark while on your transactions page with the desired transactions selected.
